# Weather Predictor App
_Iâ€™m working with Courtney Whitson, Linete Estrada, Robby Wilcox, Nick Wilkins to build a weather app so 
that end users can be aware of weather conditions for the day or week, and can properly prepare for the day with tips provided by the app. We are building a weather app to prevent weather confusion throughout the day. _

__General Info:__

* ![weather icon](https://www.iconfinder.com/data/icons/luchesa-vol-9/128/Weather-512.png)
* /* Optional to add missing things that we could of used in our project */

__Technologies Used:__

* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product)
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)

__Features:__

1. Clothing Predictor
    * In progress by Linete Estrada. This is located in the notifications.py file. 
	* This feature will use current weather conditions to recommend clothing articles to users, such as student, daily. 
	* As a student, I can get recommendations on clothing articles to wear so that I dress appropriately for the current weather conditions 
	
2. Weather Pattern Detector 
	* This feature will notify users, such as students, of changing weather patterns throughout the day  
	* As a student, I can receive weather notifications so that I am up to date with current weather patterns.
	
2. Weather API
	* Completed by Robby Wilcox. This is the way that the weatherapp is getting information to run the rest of the application. This is located in the WeatherAPI.py file
3. Weatherapp site
	* The base layout is completed,  but it is still a blank slate because we have not implemented the code in yet
Status of Project: We currently have a running program that is not connected to the back end where all the information enters. Next step is to get all of the files talking with one another so that we can start compiling a running demo of weather information.	
	
__Robby Wilcox's Next Steps:__

1. Polish up the weather API file so that it prints out the information in a way that meshes well with the other aspects of our program. In the end it will create easy to read and easy to manipulate data so that any team member can work on the data with little more than a quick brushup on the readme file.

__Linete Estrada's Next Steps:__

1. Design a mock version of our GUI to know exactly what we want the actual GUI to look like 
2. Clean up the current UI to match the GUI mock version 

Status of the Project: Currently have a mock version of the Clothing Predictor notifications that the user will be able to see. Next step is to expand the notification tab and include it into the main updated UI.

__Courtney Whitson's Next Steps:__

Status of Project: The Main executable file is functional, but only displays a Label to verify that the window launches.  


1. Connect all the modules to the main executable, and build up the GUI and UI design. Will also begin writing up the test cases for verifying the functionality of the weather app.

__Nick Wilkins's Next Steps:__
1. Fill in  the UML using the code from mater branch  using pynsource 
2. Have a showcase application on the master branch so that we can present
