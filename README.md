# Weather Predictor App
_Iâ€™m working with Courtney Whitson, Linete Estrada, Robby Wilcox, Nick Wilkins to build a weather app so 
that end users can be aware of weather conditions for the day or week, and can properly prepare for the day with tips provided by the app. We are building a weather app to prevent future weather pattern confusion throughout the day. _
