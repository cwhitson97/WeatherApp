# Weather Predictor App
_Iâ€™m working with Courtney Whitson, Linete Estrada, Robby Wilcox, Nick Wilkins to build a weather app so 
that end users can be aware of weather conditions for the day or week, and can properly prepare for the day with tips provided by the app. We are building a weather app to prevent weather confusion throughout the day. _

__General Info:__

* ![weather icon](https://www.iconfinder.com/data/icons/luchesa-vol-9/128/Weather-512.png)
* /* Optional to add missing things that we could of used in our project */

__Technologies Used:__

* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product)
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)

__Features:__

1. Clothing Predictor
	* This feature will use current weather conditions to recommend clothing articles to users, such as student, daily. 
	* As a student, I can get recommendations on clothings articles to wear so that I dress appropriately for the current weather conditions 
	
2. Weather Pattern Detector 
	* This feature will notify users, such as students, of changing weather patterns throughout the day  
	* As a student, I can receive weather notifications so that I am up to date with current weather patterns.
	
2. Weather API
	* Completed by Robby Wilcox. This is the way that the weatherapp is getting information to run the rest of the application.
	
__Robby Wilcox's Next Steps:__

Status of Project: We currently have a running program that is not connected to the back end where all the information enters. Next step is to get all of the files talking with one another so that we can start ocmpiling a running demo of weather information.

1. Polish up the weather API file so that it prints out the information in a way that meshes well with the other aspects of our program. In the end it will create easy to read and easy to manipulate data so that any team member can work on the data with little more than a quick brushup on the readme file.
